# turtle-pong

A simple pong game written in Python using the turtle module.

This pong game is nothing too complicated, and not extremely polished. If you didn't know, the famous game of Pong is a table tennis-themed arcade video game originally developed by Atari, where two players control a white paddle each and prevent the ball from breaching their space.

In this knock-off version, Player 1 can control the left paddle by pressing "W" or "S", and Player 2 can control the right paddle by pressing the up and down arrows.

## Local Setup

This project was built using the [Turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) library in Python 3.

1. To run this game locally, clone this repository and cd (change directory) into this repository.

2. Ensure that you have the Turtle library installed. If not, you can run:

```bash
pip install turtle
```

3. Execute the pong.py file using Python.

```bash
python pong.py
```

4. And voila, you have a semi-functioning game of Pong, right inside your machine!
