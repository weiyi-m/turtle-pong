# turtle-pong

This project was made for [MLH INIT 2022](https://organize.mlh.io/participants/events/6813-init-2022): Day 1.

A simple pong game written in Python using the turtle module.

This pong game is nothing too complicated, and not extremely polished. If you didn't know, the famous game of Pong is a table tennis-themed arcade video game originally developed by Atari, where two players control a white paddle each and prevent the ball from breaching their space.

In this knock-off version, Player 1 can control the left paddle by pressing "W" or "S", and Player 2 can control the right paddle by pressing the up and down arrows.

## Local Setup

This project was built using the [Turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) library in Python 3.

1. To run this game locally, clone this repository and cd (change directory) into this repository.

2. Ensure that you have the Turtle library installed. If not, you can run:

```bash
pip install turtle
```

3. Execute the pong.py file using Python.

```bash
python pong.py
```

4. And voila, you have a semi-functioning game of Pong, right inside your machine!

## Inspiration
This game was inspired by Atari's Pong, developed by Allan Alcorn. According to the Wikipedia page for Pong, it is a "table tennis-themed arcade sports video game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics."  Pong was released in 1972, and contained two controllable balls and a fast-moving ball.

## What it does
Turtle Pong is a Pong game written entirely using the Turtle module in Python (sorry, but you're not actually going to deflect a moving turtle). Just like the original Pong, the paddles can be controlled by two players. 

The left paddle can be controlled using the "W" and "S" keys, whilst the right paddle can be controlled using the up and down arrow keys. It's a game that can only be run on a local machine (I would make it online if I knew how to), meaning that you need physical people over to play (which, in these times, can be a bit hard, so I apologise for any inconveniences!)

## How I built it
The idea for Turtle Pong came at around April in school, but I haven't worked on the idea until now. My senior was teaching us how to create a Flappy Bird game using Turtle, and challenged us to think of other game ideas using Turtle. I thought of Pong, but didn't bother to code it until this event happened.

So I booted up VSCode, opened the Turtle library documentation, watched some snippets of Python turtle-rials (bad pun I'm sorry), and came up with the code that's behind the knock-off Pong game.

## Challenges I ran into
There were plenty of challenges that I ran into while developing this game. Details such as the correct width and height, the speed of the ball, moving the paddles, and aligning the score at the centre of the screen were, at times, frustrating to code. But I calmed down, pulled through, analysed my code, and although there are still some bugs involving the ball phasing through the paddle, I feel that I can call Turtle Pong a success.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Although there were many errors in the bumpy road of development, each fix came with a little shout of success in my head. There wasn't a defining moment of accomplishment, but overall, I'm just proud that the game works.

## What I learned
This coding journey taught me quite a few development skills. I hadn't explored Turtle in-depth, and I feel that this project showed me the many functions of Turtle and what it's capable of. 

## What's next for Turtle Pong
As mentioned in the "What it does" section, Turtle Pong can only be run on a machine of some sort, which can make it hard for actual multiplayer gameplay to suffice due to the unusual circumstances of our time. I'm intending to look into the methods of hosting games online in the near/distant future (we'll see how it goes), and I might make Turtle Pong accessible by anyone.
